# VerticalTwitch

## Moves chat below the video on vertical/potrait screens

### Install // Setup

You'll first want Tampermonkey/Greasemonkey for your relevant browser then to install this script head to: https://github.com/tomouchuu/vertical-twitch/raw/master/index.user.js and tampermonkey should prompt you to install the script.

Now on any twitch stream (&maybe video) you should be able to init the script by selecting it in the tampermonkey window and it'll move chat to below the video.
